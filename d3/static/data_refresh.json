It looks like I am saying something really sweet and my now wife is falling in love with it. In actuality, I am smiling and threatening a stalker of hers in high school. The message was a pretty violent promise if he didn't stop. Everyone loves the pictures in her scrapbook, and only she and I know the full story. We don't even remember who took the photos, but they were in an old disposable camera we got developed. It was a day we remember because we were wearing our junior year field day shirts. We still had silly string in our hair too. \n\nBefore anyone asks...I don't feel bad about it. The dude kept trying to caress her leg when she was playing saxophone and putting pictures of her into her locker with creepy messages on the back detailing how he got the photo without her looking.
